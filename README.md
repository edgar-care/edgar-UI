# edgar
A component library for Flutter applications. This library is a collection of widgets that can be used to build Flutter applications. The library is designed to be used in a modular way, so that you can use only the components that you need.

---
The main usage of this library is to be used in the edgar apps project.

## Features
edgar has a number of features that make it easier to build Flutter applications:
- A collection of custom buttons
- A collection of custom date picker
- A collection of custom modals
- A collection of custom text fields
- A pagination widget
- A snackbar widget
- A collection of custom colors
- A collection of custom texts

## Usage
To use the edgar library in your Flutter application, add the following dependency to your `pubspec.yaml` file with Flutter:

```bash
 $ flutter pub add edgar
```

This will add a line like this to your package's pubspec.yaml (and run an implicit flutter pub get):
```yaml
dependencies:
  edgar: ^0.2.2
```
Alternatively, your editor might support `flutter pub get`. Check the docs for your editor to learn more.

Now in your Dart code, you can use:

```dart
import 'package:edgar/colors.dart';
import 'package:edgar/widget.dart';
```

You can now use the components in the library in your Flutter application.

## Changelog
See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) file for a list of changes in each version of the library.
